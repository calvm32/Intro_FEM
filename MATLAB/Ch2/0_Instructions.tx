Chapter 2: The Finite Element Method in 1D

Assume the model problem is

    -(au')' = f, for x in [0,L]
    au'(0) = k_0(u(0) - g_0)
    -au'(L) = k_1(u(L) - g_L)

where , k_0, k_L >= 0, g_0, g_L are constants, 
f is a given function, and a>0 is a given function.

We call kappa=[k_0, k_L] and g=[g_0, g_L].

Using this notation, substitute values into Solver1D.m.
