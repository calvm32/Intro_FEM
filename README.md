# Introductory FEM Solvers

This is based on chapters from The Finite Element Method: Theory, Implementation, and Applications by Mats G. Larson and Fredrik Bengzon.

Some solvers are made with Python, MATLAB, or both. My goal is to have them all made with Python so that I can easily copy/paste the code and modify with libraries like FireDrake.
